# TerraformVPC_Project
This project demonstrates the use of Terraform for provisioning AWS resources. It includes creating a VPC, subnets, an internet gateway, an EC2 instance, a load balancer, and deploying a status website. The website is accessible via the DNS of the load balancer. The Terraform state file is securely stored in an S3 bucket.
